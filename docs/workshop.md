# Build serverless intelligent Apps with Azure Functions Flex Consumption and extension for OpenAI

> Azure Functions offers a powerful and dev-friendly platform for creating serverless applications that can scale effortlessly.

> In this workshop, you'll learn how to build an intelligent application that summarizes audio files using Azure Functions and Azure OpenAI.

> You'll start by utilizing the new Flex Consumption tier of Azure Functions, which provides a flexible, secure, and cost-effective way to run your serverless workloads.

> You'll then leverage Cognitive Services to transcribe audio files into text.

> Next, you'll use the OpenAI extension to connect Azure Functions with Azure OpenAI, enabling you to generate summaries from the transcribed text.

> Throughout the lab, all communication will be secured using managed identities and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), providing a robust security framework for your application.
